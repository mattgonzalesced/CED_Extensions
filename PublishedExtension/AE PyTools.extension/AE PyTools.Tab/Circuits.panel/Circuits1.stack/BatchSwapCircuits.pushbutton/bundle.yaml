    Description:

    Batch Swap Circuits transfers electrical circuits between panels in Revit. It filters and lists compatible target panels based on distribution system compatibility and provides a summary of the reassigned circuits.

    
    To use:

    Start by selecting a panel or circuit, or let the tool auto-detect a starting panel. Choose the circuits to move from the list associated with the starting panel. Then, select a compatible target panel to complete the transfer.
