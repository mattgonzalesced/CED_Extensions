    Description:
    
    Orients selected model elements to face 'plan west' while 
    maintaining their position. Useful if many elements need to
    face the same direction. 
    
    
    SHIFT+Click: 
    
    Configure how the tool handles tag position and rotation. By default, tags are repositioned 
    to maintain their relative distance from their host. Tag Rotation is not yet available.
    
    Note: 
    This ignores Annotations, Pinned Elements, System Families, 
    and Face-Based Elements hosted to vertical walls.
