Add YAML Profiles
Captures only dependent tags, so loose detail components are ignored. Parameter harvesting is
limited and duplicate entries appear when the tool is run multiple times.

Delete YAML Profiles
The UI cannot distinguish duplicate labels and deletions happen immediately with no backup. The
fallback parser may reorder YAML.

Edit YAML Profiles
Type dropdown is keyed only by label, so duplicates overlap. The parameter grid exposes existing
keys only, and tag validation is minimal.

Load Equipment Definition
No filtering is available; every linked definition drops at once and missing families are skipped
silently. Tags only will be loaded on the active view.

PlaceElements
Malformed CSV rows or missing families cause the single transaction to roll back. dev-Group IDs are
ignored, so placements can land in the wrong zones.

Set New XYZ Offset
Assumes the selected element maps to a unique label; misclicking edits the wrong definition and tag
offsets stay stale. 

Set New Rotation Offset
Double-counts rotation when the element was already rotated, updates only the first offset entry,
and ignores tag rotation. Need a way for this to just know which equipment we want offset without 
picking an equipment definition, probably we should add a parameter to everything called
Equipment Definition ID in revit, clear this with Tony. Otherwise the program will never know which 
element you want modified unless you select it, it can narrow down by family type label right now, 
but theres a lot of duplex wall receptacles to say the least.

Tag Equipment
Strict dev-Group ID matching blocks tagging when the parameter is blank. Dedupe collapses
intentional duplicate tags and leader lines are forced on.
