Add YAML Profiles
Captures only dependent tags, so loose detail components are ignored. Parameter harvesting is
limited and duplicate entries appear when the tool is run multiple times.

@@@Dependent tags is an issue and I only harvest CKT params and dev group ID

Delete YAML Profiles
The UI cannot distinguish duplicate labels and deletions happen immediately with no backup. The
fallback parser may reorder YAML. 

@@@This is not a problem everything logs to insertyamlfilehere.log

Edit YAML Profiles
Type dropdown is keyed only by label, so duplicates overlap. The parameter grid exposes existing
keys only, and tag validation is minimal.

@@@the first sentence of this has been fixed.

Load Equipment Definition
No filtering is available; every linked definition drops at once and missing families are skipped
silently. Tags only will be loaded on the active view.

@@@not really an issue

PlaceElements
Malformed CSV rows or missing families cause the single transaction to roll back. dev-Group IDs are
ignored, so placements can land in the wrong zones.

@@@not really an issue

Set New XYZ Offset
Assumes the selected element maps to a unique label; misclicking edits the wrong definition and tag
offsets stay stale. 

@@@This needs to support tag offsets

Set New Rotation Offset
Double-counts rotation when the element was already rotated, updates only the first offset entry,
and ignores tag rotation. 


###Need a way for these XYZ and Rotation to just know which equipment we want offset without 
picking an equipment definition, probably we should add a parameter to everything called
Equipment Definition ID in revit, clear this with Tony. Otherwise the program will never know which 
element you want modified unless you select it, it can narrow down by family type label right now, 
but theres a lot of duplex wall receptacles to say the least.

@@@This needs to support tag offsets

Tag Equipment
Strict dev-Group ID matching blocks tagging when the parameter is blank. Dedupe collapses
intentional duplicate tags and leader lines are forced on.

@@@Once we have equipment ID as a parameter we should sort by that instead of dev-Group ID, we can make 
PlaceElements give each element placed a unique Equipment Definition ID in its parameters.
