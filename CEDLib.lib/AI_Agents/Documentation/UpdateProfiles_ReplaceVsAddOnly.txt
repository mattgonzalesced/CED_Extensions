Update Profiles - Replace vs Add-Only Option

Overview
- Goal: Add a replace vs add-only option so tags, keynotes, and text notes can either overwrite existing profile data or only append new items.
- Background: Update Profiles currently merges items; the plan introduces an explicit global toggle and replacement choices.

Scope
- In scope: Review merge behavior for tags/keynotes/text notes; define a global toggle (default add-only) and global replacement set choices; update UI to surface choices; carry choices through the decision payload; implement replace logic; ensure keynotes use GA_Keynote Symbol_CED family; validate and update messaging.
- Out of scope: None specified in the plan.

Plan summary
- Steps:
  1) Review Update Profiles pipeline to confirm current merge behavior and decision points.
  2) Define user-facing behavior: global add-only vs replace toggle (default add-only) and global replacement set choices.
  3) Update the Update Profiles UI to present the toggle and separate union/common choices for tags and keynotes, then pass through the existing decision payload.
  4) Implement merge logic that clears existing items before replace; keep add-only as current behavior; ensure keynotes use GA_Keynote Symbol_CED family.
  5) Validate with sample profiles and update success messaging if needed.

Behavior details
- Default behavior remains add-only; replace explicitly clears prior items before applying selected sets.
- UI exposes separate union/common choices for tags and keynotes.
- Keynotes must use the GA_Keynote Symbol_CED family during placement/merge.

Risks
- Replace may discard curated data not present on instances.
- Tags and keynotes may be stored on separate paths; missing one path can cause inconsistencies.
- Mixed per-row decisions can be confusing without clear UI scope and defaults.

Open questions
- None.

Validation checklist
- Add-only preserves existing items while appending new ones.
- Replace removes prior items and applies only the selected set.
- Keynotes resolve through GA_Keynote Symbol_CED family.
- Success messaging reflects the chosen mode and outcomes.

Assumptions
- The Update Profiles decision payload can carry the new global toggle and replacement choices.
- The UI framework supports adding the global toggle and union/common choices for tags and keynotes.
