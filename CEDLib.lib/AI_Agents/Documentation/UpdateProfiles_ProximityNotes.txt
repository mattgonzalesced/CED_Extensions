Update Profiles - Proximity Capture for Keynotes and Text Notes

Overview
- Goal: Capture keynotes and text notes by proximity so notes within 5 ft (XY only) of an Element_Linker host attach to that host's profile, choosing the closest host and preventing duplicates across profiles by location.
- Background: Update Profiles currently gathers notes without proximity matching; the new flow maps notes to nearby hosts.

Scope
- In scope: Identify current note collection/mapping; define proximity rules (5 ft XY-only radius, closest host, location-based dedupe); add spatial lookup for Element_Linker hosts; resolve each note to nearest eligible host; enforce uniqueness by location; handle exact-distance ties via user selection; ensure GA_Keynote Symbol_CED keynotes store without extra rotation; verify behavior.
- Out of scope: No migration of existing profile notes.

Plan summary
- Steps:
  1) Locate where Update Profiles gathers keynotes/text notes and how it maps them to profiles.
  2) Define proximity rules: 5 ft radius in XY only (ignore Z), closest host, and location-based dedupe key.
  3) Build or reuse a host-element spatial lookup (Element_Linker only) and resolve each note to the nearest host using insertion point XY distance.
  4) Enforce uniqueness by location across profiles; skip notes already assigned (track assigned XYZ keys).
  5) If distances tie exactly, prompt the user to select the host profile.
  6) Ensure GA_Keynote Symbol_CED keynotes are stored without adding a 90-degree rotation (no extra rotation during capture).
  7) Verify: closest host wins (or user selection on ties); notes outside 5 ft are ignored.

Behavior details
- Notes are assigned based on insertion point XY distance to eligible Element_Linker hosts only (ignore Z).
- A location-based key prevents duplicate note assignment across profiles.
- Tie handling requires explicit user choice when distances are equal.

Risks
- Floating-point noise may cause inconsistent host selection or duplicate detection without XY tolerances.
- Large models may need spatial indexing to keep proximity searches fast.
- Notes near linked model boundaries might match unintended hosts if context is ignored.

Open questions
- None.

Validation checklist
- Notes within 5 ft attach to the nearest eligible host profile.
- Notes outside 5 ft are ignored.
- Location-based dedupe prevents duplicate assignment across profiles.
- Tie cases prompt for user selection and resolve deterministically.
- GA_Keynote Symbol_CED keynotes are stored without extra rotation.

Assumptions
- Element_Linker identifies the eligible host elements for proximity matching.
- Note insertion points are available for distance calculations.
