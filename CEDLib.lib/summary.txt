Summary of Let There Be YAML updates
====================================
1. Shared YAML selection and caching
   - Added LogicClasses/yaml_path_cache.py and a Select YAML pushbutton so the user sets the active
     profileData file once per session. Every Let There Be YAML tool now imports the cache helper,
     reuses the stored path, and updates the cache whenever the file picker returns a new location.

2. Unified logging
   - All tools now log to a single profileData.log alongside the selected YAML. Log entries include
     the action name (add, delete, edit, set_xyz_offset, set_rotation_offset, etc.) so auditing is
     centralized and easier to track.

3. Script updates
   - Add/Delete/Edit YAML Profiles, Load Equipment Definition, PlaceElements, Set New XYZ Offset,
     Set New Rotation Offset, and Tag Equipment were refactored to use the cached path and shared
     log. Each script now honors the cached selection by default, only prompting the user when no
     path is stored or the file is missing.

4. Tag placement behavior
   - Load Equipment Definition no longer prompts for target views; tag definitions always map to the
     active view for faster, predictable tests. PlaceElementsEngine now calls IndependentTag.Create
     with leader lines enabled, enforcing a consistent tag style across tools.

5. Tag Equipment refinements
   - Tag Equipment groups tags by family/type, filters hosts strictly by dev-Group ID, and maintains
     a (host id, tag key) set so each element only receives one instance of a tag. The streamlined
     placement relies on the updated engine, so leader behavior matches the rest of the suite.

6. Rotation tool improvements
   - Set New Rotation Offset auto-resolves the linked definition based on the selected element’s
     label. If multiple matches exist, it picks the exact label match without prompting, eliminating
     the extra dialog when a CAD profile contains multiple types.

7. Documentation
   - Added detailed internal (`LetThereBeYamlExplainedDEV.txt`) and user-facing
     (`LetTheeBeYamlExplainedDesign.txt`) descriptions covering how each button works. The
     potential-issues list (`LetThereBeYAMLPotentialIssues.txt`) was regenerated to reflect the
     current toolset.
