  Description:

  Replaces an existing circuit placeholder with real connector elements.


  Select a placeholder circuit in a panel schedule, choose matching connector types,
  and they will be added to the circuit. The placeholder will be deleted. The tool will filter
  out any elements that do not match the circuits Voltage and Poles.
  
  Note: 
  
  This tool has been 'unlocked' to be compatible with any 'CED Standard' electrical fixture.
  The only requirement is that it has some value entered in the 
  "Refrigeration Circuit Number_CEDT" parameter. 
  
  So, if you need to replace a placeholder with a receptacle or disconnect, simply give that element
  some value in the "Refrigeration Circuit Number_CEDT" parameter and it will show up as an option.
