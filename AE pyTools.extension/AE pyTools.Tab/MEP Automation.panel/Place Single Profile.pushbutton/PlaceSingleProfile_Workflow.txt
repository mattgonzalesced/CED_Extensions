Use Place Single Profile to open a dockable pane and place one equipment
definition from the active YAML at a picked point. You can optionally filter
the list to independent profiles only.

Select the equipment definition (grouped by truth-source metadata); the pane
shows a simple 2D preview of the stored offsets. Pick a base point, and the
tool places the parent instance. If the profile has linked child definitions,
you can choose to place those as well at their stored offsets and rotations.
