title: Place Annotations
tooltip: |
  If your equipment definitions capture hosted tags, keynotes, or text notes,
  run Place Annotations after a placement pass to ensure every instance
  receives the recorded annotation offsets and orientations described in the
  YAML.

  The tool scans for Element_Linker metadata, queries the definition to retrieve
  tag/keynote families plus text note entries, and instantiates them on the
  specified view with the stored offsets, rotation, and parameter overrides.

  Because tags depend on view context, launch the workflow from the sheet or plan
  where you want them to appear, and rerun for additional views if needed; the
  automation reuses the same metadata, so you never have to reselect hosts.

  If any annotations fail to place, review the output for missing family
  warnings, then update the definition or load the required families before
  rerunning the command to finish annotation.
