Run Place Annotations after Select Parent, Add YAML Profiles, or Place Linked
Elements whenever a definition includes hosted tags, keynotes, or text notes.
The command looks up each instance by its Element_Linker payload, filters by
dev-Group so you only target the intended equipment, and drops the captured
annotations at their recorded offsets within the active view.

Launch it from whatever plan or sheet you need annotated; rerun for additional
views as required. If an annotation family or text style is missing, the summary
lists the LED ID so you can load the family or edit the definition and run Place
Annotations again.
