Run Audit Linked Model to scan linked documents for equipment names that do
not exist in the active YAML but appear to match existing profiles. The tool
normalizes names, removes common direction/number tokens, and uses token overlap
and fuzzy matching to find likely candidates.

You can select which missing names to create. For each selection, the tool
clones the closest matching profile, assigns a new EQ/SET ID, and writes the
new definitions back into Extensible Storage.
