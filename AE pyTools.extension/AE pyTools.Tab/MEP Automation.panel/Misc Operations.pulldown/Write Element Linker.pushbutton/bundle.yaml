title: Write Element Linker
tooltip: |
  Writes Element_Linker metadata onto fixtures and model groups that are missing it.
  Matching uses the active YAML profiles and chooses the best LED by parameter score,
  without relying on element XYZ location for matching.

  If there are multiple LEDs with the same label and no clear parameter winner,
  the element is skipped to avoid incorrect assignments.
