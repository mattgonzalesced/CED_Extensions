Run Place Annotations after Select Parent, Add YAML Profiles, or Place Linked
Elements whenever a definition includes hosted tags, keynotes, or text notes.
The tool first lets you choose which annotation types to place, then (optionally)
filter by specific tag/keynote/text-note definitions before placement.

If elements are selected in the active view, placement is limited to that
selection; otherwise the entire view is scanned. The command resolves instances
by Element_Linker payload, filters by dev-Group to target the intended
equipment, and drops the captured annotations at their recorded offsets.

Launch it from whatever plan or sheet you need annotated; rerun for additional
views as required. If an annotation family or text style is missing, the summary
lists the LED ID so you can load the family or edit the definition and run Place
Annotations again.
