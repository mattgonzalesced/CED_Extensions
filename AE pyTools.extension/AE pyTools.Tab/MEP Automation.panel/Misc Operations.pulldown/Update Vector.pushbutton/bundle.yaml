title: Update Vector
tooltip: |
  Update Vector recalculates the centroid and offset vector data for an existing
  equipment definition without forcing you to re-run Add YAML Profiles; use it
  when the layout changes slightly but the components remain identical.

  Pick the equipment definition, then select the elements inside the model that
  represent the new footprint; the tool measures their relative spacing and
  updates the linked element offsets accordingly.

  Parameters and tags remain untouched, so the change is limited to geometric
  placement, which helps keep QA/QC reports aligned with what you just installed
  while preserving circuits and metadata.

  After confirming, the updated vectors are written to Extensible Storage; rerun
  Place Linked Elements or Tag Equipment to see the new arrangement take effect
  in production views.
