Use Place by Room to place selected profiles inside rooms from a linked model.
Pick the profiles, the linked model, and the rooms to target; the UI then lets
you set per-room profile multipliers and per-type counts.

Placement points are computed from linked room boundaries, with spacing based
on the profile rotation and symbol size. After placement, the tool nudges new
instances to balance the edge gaps against the internal spacing.
