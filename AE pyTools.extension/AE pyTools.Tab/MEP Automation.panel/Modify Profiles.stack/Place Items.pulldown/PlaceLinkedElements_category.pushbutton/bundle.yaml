title: Place Linked Elements (Category Filter)
tooltip: |
  Place Linked Elements with Category Filter allows you to select specific
  equipment categories before placement. It reads the active YAML, prompts you
  to choose which categories to place, then matches linked elements or Revit
  links by name.

  Before running, ensure Select YAML has loaded the desired file and that the
  project contains host families or linked groups whose names align with the
  equipment definitions you want to place.

  The category selection dialog shows all unique categories found in the YAML
  file. Select one or more categories to place only those equipment types.

  After placement, inspect the resulting families, run QAQC if needed, and commit
  any required tweaks through Add, Edit, or Merge before exporting the updated
  YAML back to disk for coordination.
