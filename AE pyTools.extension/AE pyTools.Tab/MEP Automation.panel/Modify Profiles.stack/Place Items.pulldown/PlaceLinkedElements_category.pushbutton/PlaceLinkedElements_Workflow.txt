Place Linked Elements now consumes the exact offsets, parent rotation, tags,
and parameters stored in Extensible Storage. After selecting the active YAML,
the tool scans the project (and linked models) for matching host names, then
creates every Linked Element Definition at the saved location relative to its
parent’s frame.

Because Element_Linker payloads are written during placement, Undo/Redo,
Update Vector, Tag Equipment, and QA/QC can immediately track each instance by
its LED ID. If a host is missing, the summary callout lets you know so you can
fix the naming before rerunning the command.

Run this after Select Parent Element or Update Vector to push the refreshed
layouts back into the model. Once the pass completes, feel free to launch QAQC
or Tag Equipment—both tools read the same metadata and require no additional
manual work.
