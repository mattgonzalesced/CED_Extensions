title: Merge Profiles
tooltip: |
  Launch Merge YAML Profiles when two equipment definitions describe identical
  assemblies but differ only by naming convention; it lets you treat one entry as
  the truth and clone its configuration across the others.

  Pick the authoritative definition first, then select every secondary definition
  that should inherit the same linked sets, offsets, parent filters, and prompts,
  ensuring future placements deliver a consistent result regardless of name.

  The merge copies everything except the name and id fields; that means schedules
  and documentation can still reference the unique labels while the automation
  reuses the same underlying placement recipe.

  After confirming the summary, the tool writes the updates back into Extensible
  Storage, logging the activity so you can undo through Revit history if
  necessary, and the placer immediately benefits without further customization.
