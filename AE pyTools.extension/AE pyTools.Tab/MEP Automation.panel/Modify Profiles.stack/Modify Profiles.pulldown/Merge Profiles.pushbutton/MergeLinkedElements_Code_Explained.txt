Merge Linked Elements – Code Explained
======================================

Purpose
-------
Normalize multiple equipment definitions that represent the same physical
assembly.  Instead of duplicating configurations (GO Checkstand 1 vs 2), this
tool lets you designate a “truth” definition and clone its structure into other
definitions without rewriting the placer.

Execution Flow
--------------
1. **Load YAML** – Retrieve the active dataset via `load_active_yaml_data`.
2. **Select Source** – Use `SelectFromList` to pick the authoritative definition.
3. **Choose Targets** – Present remaining definitions as merge targets; the user
   can pick any number.
4. **Copy Fields** – `_copy_fields` clones all keys except `name` and `id` from
   the source into each target, preserving linked sets, parameters, relations,
   etc.
5. **Save** – `save_active_yaml_data` writes the new data with action metadata
   “Merge Linked Elements,” ensuring undo history captures the change.

Considerations
--------------
* IDs remain unique so documentation can still reference individual definitions.
* Because the placer reads definitions independently, no code change is needed;
  multiple names now resolve to identical LED lists.
