Run Unmerge Profiles to detach a profile from a merged truth-source group.
Select the merged group, then choose the member profile to unmerge.

The tool resets the truth-source metadata on the selected entry so it becomes
its own source again, then saves the updated YAML back into Extensible
Storage.
