Use Manage Profiles to review and edit equipment_definitions in a structured
UI. Select a profile to edit parameters, add/remove equipment, tags, text
notes, or keynotes, or create independent profiles with absolute placements.

When adding items without offsets, placement defaults to the parent center; set
offsets and rotation to control placement. Saving writes all changes back into
Extensible Storage for immediate use by placement tools.
