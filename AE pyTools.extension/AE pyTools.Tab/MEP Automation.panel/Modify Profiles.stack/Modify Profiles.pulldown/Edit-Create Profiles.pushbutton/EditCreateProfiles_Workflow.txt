Run Edit-Create Profiles to build a parent/child definition from model
elements. Choose whether the parent is in a linked model or the host model; if
linked, select the link instance first and then the parent element.

Select the equipment, tags, text notes, and keynotes to capture. The tool
records XYZ offsets and rotation relative to the parent and stores them as a
linked set inside the profile entry in Extensible Storage.

If a profile already exists for the parent type, it is placed for preview so
you can append or adjust items before saving.
