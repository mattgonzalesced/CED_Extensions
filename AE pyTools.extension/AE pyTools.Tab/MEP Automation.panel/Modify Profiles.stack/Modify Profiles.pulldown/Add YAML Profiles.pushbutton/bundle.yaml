title: Add YAML Profiles
tooltip: |
  Start by running Select YAML so the profile data you intend to edit is loaded
  into Extensible Storage; the Add YAML tool always writes changes to that active
  copy, keeping the original file untouched.

  Choose the equipment definition that should receive new linked element types,
  or create a new definition if you are capturing an arrangement that has never
  been described before inside the YAML library.

  Pick every Revit element that belongs to the configuration, including hosted
  tags or nested groups; the tool captures zeroed offsets and circuit parameters
  so that placements later match the exact assembly you just recorded.

  After confirming the summary, the tool updates Element_Linker metadata on the
  selected elements, saves the YAML back into the project, and displays a success
  message reminding you to reload Place Elements if you are actively placing.
