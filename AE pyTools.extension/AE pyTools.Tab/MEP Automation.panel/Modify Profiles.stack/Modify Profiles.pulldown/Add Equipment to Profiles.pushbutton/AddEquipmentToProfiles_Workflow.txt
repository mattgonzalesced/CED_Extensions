Run Add Equipment to Profiles to append items to an existing profile without
re-running the full Edit-Create workflow. Select the parent, then select the
equipment to add.

The tool calculates each element's offset and rotation relative to the parent
and writes new linked element definitions into the profile entry stored in
Extensible Storage.
