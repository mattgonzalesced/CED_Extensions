title: Import YAML File
tooltip: |
  Select YAML is the entry point for every workflow in this dropdown; it seeds the
  active project with the YAML file you want to edit or place from by copying its
  contents into Extensible Storage on Project Information.

  Choose the file, confirm the prompt, and the tool caches the path for future
  sessions so you can reload the same dataset without browsing repeatedly; it
  also clears prior history related to other files to avoid cross contamination.

  Once loaded, every other button reads or writes to the in-model copy rather
  than the disk file, which means undo, redo, QA/QC, and export all share the
  same authoritative source.

  Run Select YAML again anytime you need to switch datasets or refresh from a new
  export; the extension will alert you that the change succeeded so there is no
  ambiguity about which profile set is currently active.
