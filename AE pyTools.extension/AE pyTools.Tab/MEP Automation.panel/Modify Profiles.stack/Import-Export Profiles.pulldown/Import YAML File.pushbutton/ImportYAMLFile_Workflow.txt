Run Import YAML File to load a dataset into Extensible Storage for the active
project. The tool prompts for a YAML file, caches the selected path, sanitizes
hash characters, and parses the equipment_definitions schema before writing the
normalized text into Project Information.

After import, every MEP Automation tool reads the in-model copy, not the disk
file. To switch datasets or refresh from a new export, run Import YAML File
again and the cached path updates for the next session.
