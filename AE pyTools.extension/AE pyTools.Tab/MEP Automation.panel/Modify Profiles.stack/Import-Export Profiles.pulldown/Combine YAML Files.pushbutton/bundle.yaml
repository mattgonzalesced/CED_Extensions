title: Combine YAML Files
tooltip: |
  Combine two equipment-definition YAML files into a new file.

  The tool preserves all entries from the first YAML, then renumbers IDs
  from the second YAML so they continue after the highest ID in the first.

  The combined file can be loaded into Extensible Storage just like any
  other dataset for placing or editing profiles.
