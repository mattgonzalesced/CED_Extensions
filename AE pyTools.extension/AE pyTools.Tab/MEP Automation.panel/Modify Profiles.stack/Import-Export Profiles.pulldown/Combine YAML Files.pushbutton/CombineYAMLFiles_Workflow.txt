Use Combine YAML Files to merge two datasets into a new file for automation
team workflows. Select the first YAML as the primary source, then select the
second YAML to append.

The tool parses both equipment_definitions lists, finds the highest numeric ID
in the first file, and renumbers IDs from the second file to continue that
sequence (preserving prefix and padding). The combined output is written to a
new YAML file without modifying the originals.
