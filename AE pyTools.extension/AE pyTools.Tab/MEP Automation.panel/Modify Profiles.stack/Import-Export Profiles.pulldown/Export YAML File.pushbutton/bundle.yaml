title: Export YAML File
tooltip: |
  Run Export YAML File whenever you want to persist the current Extensible
  Storage contents back to disk; this captures every edit from the session and
  creates an auditable snapshot for sharing or version control.

  The tool prompts for a destination path; provide a filename that reflects the
  project and date, then confirm you want to overwrite any existing artifact to
  avoid confusion among team members referencing older exports.

  Exports use the same literal-scalar formatting as Select YAML expects, so you
  can immediately reload the generated file in a fresh project without needing
  any manual cleanup or whitespace adjustments.

  After exporting, consider committing the file to source control or delivering
  it to collaborators, and remember that future edits still target the in-model
  copy until you run Select YAML again.
