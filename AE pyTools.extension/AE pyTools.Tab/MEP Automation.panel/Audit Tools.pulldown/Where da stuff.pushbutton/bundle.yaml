  Run QA/QC after any significant edit or placement session to verify which
  equipment definitions were found, how many placements occurred, and whether
  multiple linked element names still require merging.

  The tool scans the model and linked documents for Element_Linker metadata, then
  compares the counts against host elements collected from the active YAML using
  the same name matching rules as Place Linked Elements.

  Review the Markdown output in the pyRevit console: bold entries indicate
  successful placements, italics reveal pending hosts, and the summary totals list
  placed counts by definition as well as per-type breakdowns.

  Use the report to prioritize fixes, drive Merge Linked Elements decisions, or
  capture screenshots for issue tracking, then rerun the analysis after changes
  to ensure the automation remains in sync with the design intent.
