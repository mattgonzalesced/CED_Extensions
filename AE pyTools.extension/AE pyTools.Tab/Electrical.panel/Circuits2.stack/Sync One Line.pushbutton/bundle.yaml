  Description:
  
  Sync data from Equipment and Circuit Elements to corresponding
  One-Line Symbols. Data from these modeled elements can be transfered
  to any one-line symbol so long as those symbols meet the requirements below.
  
  
  Parameter Requirements for One-Line Symbols:
  
  Equipment: "Panel Name_CEDT" must match a unique "Panel Name" in the model.
  
  Circuits: "CKT_Panel_CEDT" and CKT_Circuit Number_CEDT" must match a unique
  "Panel" and "Circuit Number" in the model.
  
  
  
  Note: Only Electrical Equipment (Panelboards, Switchboards, Transformers)
  and Electrical Circuit catagories are supported at this time. Fixture and Device
  data can not be synced.
