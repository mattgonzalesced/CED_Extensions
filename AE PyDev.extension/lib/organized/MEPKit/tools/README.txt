This is what each tool does

perimeter_runner
    perimeter_runner places receptacles by space, it avoids doors, corners, and that pesky
    dairy/produce cooler - sales floor wall.
    I also put something in so that if two spaces are next to each other without a wall boundary,
    it deletes any receptacles placed in free space.
    So if you ever need to adjust the settings just go into the rules folder and edit the branch_circuit parameters.
