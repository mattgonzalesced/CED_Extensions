So identifying the rooms is fine we can do that for every building no problem.
This is where the fun begins. 
	Probably, we are gonna have to write rules for rooms for literally every code by sate, by code number, by year, etc.
	And basically I think by discipline if we just write these rules per code, and then we can just look at what state we are in, and what codes we need to follow,
	and then have our agentic AI select the correct state_code_topic.json file. 
	Another option we have is to outline each of these code books into rules, i.e. IMC_2021_ExhaustSystems.json and then we write rules for how exhaust systems should be 	created in each room type?

Codes we need to write rules for probably (watch out there will definitely be more)
