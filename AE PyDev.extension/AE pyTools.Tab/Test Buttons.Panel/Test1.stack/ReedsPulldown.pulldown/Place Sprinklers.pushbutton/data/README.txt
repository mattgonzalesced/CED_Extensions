Under data we should also have individual standards by discipline for different things in EXCEL FILES, i.e. electrical will have
lighting standards -> IES targets, spacing, clearances
electrical standards -> NEC clearances, mounting heights, naming, etc.
panel standards -> if not already defined add more stuff
The other disciplines will add their standsards under excel files here as well
