Select Parent Element Workflow Notes
===================================

- This tool captures selected child elements (receptacles, groups, etc.) and stores them as linked element definitions under the parent equipment definition selected by the user. Offsets/rotation are computed relative to the parent so future linked placements match the stored geometry.
- Because wall-hosted receptacles currently realign to face east when Place Linked Elements recreates them, designers should run **Update Vector** immediately after placement to nudge the rotation back to the intended orientation. Update Vector updates the YAML offsets/rotation so subsequent placements inherit the corrected facing.
- All other metadata captured by Select Parent (parameters, tags, linker payloads) remains accurate, so Update Vector should only need to adjust rotation unless spacing also changed.
- Once Update Vector is applied, rerun Place Linked Elements if necessary and the receptacles will retain the corrected orientation.
