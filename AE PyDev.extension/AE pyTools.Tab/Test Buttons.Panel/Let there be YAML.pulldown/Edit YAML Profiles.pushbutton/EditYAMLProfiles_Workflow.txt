Edit YAML Profiles Workflow Explanation
======================================

1. Purpose
----------
Edit YAML Profiles provides an interactive UI for modifying `profileData.yaml`. Instead of editing the YAML manually, users can view all equipment definitions, tweak offsets, parameters, tags, and metadata inside `ProfileEditorWindow`, and then save back to the canonical schema with all conversions handled for them.

2. Loading and Normalizing Data
--------------------------------
The command begins by picking the YAML file (cached path supported) and parsing it via `profile_schema.load_data`, with `_simple_yaml_parse` fallback for resilience. Because the UI layer still works with the legacy `profiles` structure, the script converts `equipment_definitions` into that form using `equipment_defs_to_legacy`. `_shims_from_dict()` then wraps each profile in a lightweight shim object (`ProfileShim`) that exposes properties/methods expected by the WPF UI.

3. Launching the Editor UI
--------------------------
`ProfileEditorWindow.xaml` lives in `CEDLib.lib/UIClasses`, and the script verifies it exists before proceeding. The shim dictionary is passed into the window, which displays a tree of equipment definitions and their linked types. Users can edit label text, category, `is_group`, dev-Group parameters, offsets, rotation, tags, and certain electrical parameters. Because all edits happen in-memory through the shims, no file writes occur until the dialog closes with OK.

4. Saving Changes Back to YAML
------------------------------
When the user confirms, `_dict_from_shims()` walks every shim and serializes its data back into the legacy dictionary format. Tags are flattened via `_serialize_tags` so offsets become plain dictionaries. The script then converts the legacy structure back into the modern equipment definitions using `legacy_to_equipment_defs`, merging into the original list so IDs and order stay intact. If `save_profile_data()` fails, the user is alerted and the original file remains untouched.

5. Guardrails and Best Practices
--------------------------------
- Only electrical-like categories retain parameter edits; `_dict_from_shims()` strips parameters for non-electrical families to avoid polluting the YAML with irrelevant fields.
- The script bails out gracefully if the YAML has no equipment definitions or the XAML is missing.
- All conversions use helper functions shared with the other commands, ensuring consistency across Add/Edit/Delete flows.

In short, Edit YAML Profiles is the safe, UI-driven way to maintain the library that Place Elements, Update Vector, and Tag Equipment all consume.
