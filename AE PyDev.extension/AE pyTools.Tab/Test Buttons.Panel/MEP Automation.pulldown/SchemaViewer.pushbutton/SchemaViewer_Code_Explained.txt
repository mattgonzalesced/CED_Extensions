Schema Viewer – Code Explained
==============================

Goal
----
Expose the Extensible Storage payload for debugging.  This includes reading the
history entries array and metadata (active YAML path, base text, next sequence
numbers) and presenting them in a user-friendly dialog.

Implementation
--------------
1. **Entity Retrieval** – Uses `ExtensibleStorage` helper to get the raw JSON
   stored under `CED_YamlHistory` schema fields (`HistoryJson`, `MetadataJson`).
2. **Deserialization** – Converts JSON strings into Python structures, handling
   missing fields gracefully.
3. **UI Rendering** – Builds a scrollable summary showing checkpoints, deltas,
   timestamps, descriptions, and metadata such as active path or base text size.
   This is often a simple `forms.alert` with a large text block.

Usage
-----
The viewer is read-only and does not trigger transactions.  It is primarily
used when diagnosing undo/redo issues, verifying that history entries exist, or
ensuring metadata like `active_yaml` aligns with expectations.
