Export YAML File – Code Explained
=================================

Goal
----
Persist the current in-model YAML (stored in Extensible Storage) to a user-
specified file on disk.  This is essentially a “publish” command so teams can
share the latest configuration outside Revit.

Core Steps
----------
1. **Fetch Active YAML** – `load_active_yaml_text` returns the path and raw text
   currently held in Extensible Storage.  Because this text already reflects all
   in-project edits, no further serialization is needed.
2. **Prompt for Destination** – Uses `forms.save_file` with a YAML filter,
   defaulting to the basename of the active path so the user sees a familiar
   filename.
3. **Write File** – Calls `io.open(..., encoding="utf-8")` to write the raw text
   exactly as stored, preserving literal block scalars and other formatting the
   schema requires.
4. **Feedback** – The script displays a success alert summarizing the output
   path, or warns the user if they cancel or if the write fails due to permissions.

Notes
-----
* No Extensible Storage modifications occur; the workflow is read-only.
* Logging is minimal but could be extended to indicate when exports happened for
  auditing purposes.
