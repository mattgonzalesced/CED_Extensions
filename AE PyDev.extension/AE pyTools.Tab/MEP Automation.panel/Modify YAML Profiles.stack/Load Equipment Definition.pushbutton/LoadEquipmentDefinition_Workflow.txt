Load Equipment Definition is a lightweight placement tool. Pick a definition
from the active YAML, choose a base point in the model, and the command drops
that configuration (parent plus children) so you can validate spacing before
running full automation.

Because it uses the same placement engine as Place Linked Elements, offsets,
tags, parameters, and Element_Linker payloads are identical. This makes it
ideal for prototyping layouts, testing new Select Parent captures, or sharing a
single configuration with the team without touching existing hosts elsewhere
in the model.

Delete the temporary instance when you’re done or convert it into the real
installation; either way, the workflow provides a fast preview of how the YAML
definition behaves in the live project.
