Place CAD Elements – Code Explained
===================================

Intent
------
Legacy helper that reads CSV data exported from CAD workflows and instantiates
families or groups accordingly.  It exists to bridge older projects onto the
YAML-based system without rewriting scripts.

Process
-------
1. **CSV Parsing** – Utilizes helpers in `LogicClasses.csv_helpers` to parse
   coordinate columns (`Position X`, `Position Y`, `Position Z`) and rotation.
2. **Repository Setup** – Builds a `ProfileRepository` from the CSV’s implied
   definitions so the placement engine can resolve labels to Revit families.
3. **Placement** – Calls `PlaceElementsEngine.place_from_csv`, which handles
   symbol activation, group placement, rotation, elevation adjustments, and
   optional tagging.

Differences from YAML Flow
--------------------------
* Does not interact with Extensible Storage; CSV is the source of truth.
* Lack of Element_Linker metadata means QA/QC and Merge workflows do not see
  these placements unless manually converted to YAML using Add Profiles later.
