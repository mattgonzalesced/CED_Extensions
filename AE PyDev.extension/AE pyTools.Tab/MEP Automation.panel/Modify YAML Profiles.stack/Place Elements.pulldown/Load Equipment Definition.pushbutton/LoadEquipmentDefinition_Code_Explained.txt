Load Equipment Definition – Code Explained
==========================================

Purpose
-------
This script exposes a read-only view of the YAML data for a single equipment
definition.  It is primarily used for verification and documentation, allowing
designers to inspect linked element definitions, offsets, parameters, and tags
without editing or placing anything.

Data Flow
---------
1. **YAML Retrieval** – `load_active_yaml_data` fetches the current dataset from
   Extensible Storage.  The path is converted to a readable label using
   `get_yaml_display_name`.
2. **Selection Dialog** – The user is shown a list of equipment definition names
   derived from `equipment_definitions`.  Once selected, the script builds a
   human-friendly summary of its contents.
3. **Formatting** – Each linked set is iterated, and the script lists LED IDs,
   labels, category names, offset tuples, parameter dictionaries, and tag
   definitions.  The goal is to provide an exact snapshot that mirrors what the
   placer will consume.
4. **Display** – The summary text is shown via `forms.alert` or a custom form,
   giving the user a scrollable, copyable readout.

Key Observations
----------------
* No changes are written back to storage; this is strictly informational.
* The script shares helper utilities with other buttons, ensuring the view uses
  the same normalized naming conventions as the placer and QA/QC tools.
