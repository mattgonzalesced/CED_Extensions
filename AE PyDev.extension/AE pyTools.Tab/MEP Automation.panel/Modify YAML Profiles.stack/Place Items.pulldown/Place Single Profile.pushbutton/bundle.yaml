title: Place Single Profile
tooltip: |
  Use Place Single Profile to inspect how a profile will drive placements
  without committing to creation; it is essentially a dry run that surfaces every
  linked element definition and its captured offsets or parameters.

  Select the target definition from the list populated by the active YAML, then
  review the dialog listing its LEDs, tags, and parent filter behavior; this helps
  confirm the structure before running an actual placement workflow.

  From here you can copy IDs, take screenshots, or communicate details to other
  team members so everyone understands what the automation will produce on the
  floor plan when the placer runs.

  Close the viewer when finished; no data is modified, and you can immediately
  switch to other tools such as Add, Delete, or Merge without reloading the YAML.
