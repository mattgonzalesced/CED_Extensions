title: Unmerge YAML Profiles
tooltip: |
  Detach a merged profile from its truth-source group so it becomes independent again.

  Select a merged group (non-indented source), then choose the merged profile
  you want to unmerge. The tool resets that profile's truth-source metadata so
  it appears as its own unindented entry in Manage YAML Profiles.

  This only updates YAML metadata; no Revit elements are deleted.
