title: Select Parent Element
tooltip: |
  Select Parent Element helps verify which Revit element satisfies the parent
  filter for a given configuration; it highlights the element, displays its
  parameters, and shows whether optional prompts will trigger.

  Launch the tool, pick the element you expect to qualify, and confirm the dialog
  states that the filter rules match; if they do not, adjust the definition
  through Edit YAML Profiles or Update Vector until the test passes.

  Because the tool reads directly from the active YAML, it is ideal for quickly
  debugging field conditions in the model without running a full placement pass
  that might fail mid way through.

  Repeat as necessary for different family types or levels; the workflow is
  non-destructive and provides immediate feedback on whether linked elements meet
  the pattern matching criteria you configured.
