Select Parent Element now captures real production data. Start by selecting the
child instances that should belong to a configuration. When prompted for the
parent, pick the host family (linked or local). The tool automatically seeds an
equipment definition if none exists, stores the parent anchor (LED-000), and
records each child’s offsets, rotation, tags, and Element_Linker payload.

Because offsets are written directly into Extensible Storage with parent
rotation, the data survives link reloads, rename operations, and matches what
Load/Place tools expect. Rerun the workflow whenever you reposition equipment:
Select Parent Element becomes the canonical way to author new linked element
definitions without manually editing YAML.
