Before deleting, confirm the Extensible Storage snapshot is the one you want to
trim. Pick an equipment definition, review the LED list (anchors are flagged as
LED-000), and choose which linked types to remove. If the last non-anchor entry
is deleted, the workflow now auto-prunes the remaining anchor and any child
relationships that referenced it, preventing orphan data.

Accepting the prompt writes the cleaned dataset back into Extensible Storage
and logs a history entry, so QA/QC and placement tools immediately see the
updated definition set.
