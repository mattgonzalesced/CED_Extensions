title: Edit YAML Profiles
tooltip: |
  Use Edit YAML Profiles for quick tweaks to an existing equipment definition
  without re-recording the entire configuration; it is ideal for changing parent
  filters, toggling prompts, or renaming linked sets.

  Load the current YAML through Select YAML first, then choose the definition you
  want to edit; the editor reflects the data stored inside Extensible Storage
  and provides simple text boxes for each editable property.

  Modify the fields you need, keeping the schema conventions in mind, then press
  Save so the workflow validates the updated payload and writes it back into the
  project document history for undo support.

  When you close the dialog, the cached YAML on disk remains unchanged until you
  explicitly export, ensuring collaborative teams always reference the in-model
  truth until they decide to publish an updated file.
