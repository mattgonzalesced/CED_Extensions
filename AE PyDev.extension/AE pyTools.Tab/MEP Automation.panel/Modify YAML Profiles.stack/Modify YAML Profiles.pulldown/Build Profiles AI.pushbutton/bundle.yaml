  Provide a spreadsheet whose first column is “Equipment”, second column is
  “Element Label”, and every remaining column represents a parameter (column
  header becomes the parameter name).  Each row becomes a linked element
  definition, and blank parameter cells are ignored.

  The agent groups rows by equipment definition, optionally clears existing
  linked elements if you choose the replace option, and auto-arranges types six
  inches apart in a circular pattern so placements don’t clash.

  After processing, review the summary, run Load Equipment Definition or QA/QC
  to inspect the data, and proceed with placement workflows as needed.
