Prepare an Excel workbook with the first column named “Equipment” and the second
column named “Element Label”.  Every column to the right represents a parameter,
where the column header is the parameter name and the cell value is the string
to store (leave cells blank to skip that parameter).  Each row describes a
linked element definition.

Launch Build Profiles AI, pick the workbook, and decide whether to replace
existing definitions with the same name.  Rows are grouped by equipment name, so
multiple rows for the same definition generate multiple linked elements.  The
tool automatically arranges each equipment’s linked elements in a circular
pattern six inches from the centroid so they do not overlap on placement.

All parameter columns are copied into the instance parameters section for each
type, while IDs, offsets, and rotation values are prefilled.  After the summary
alert reports how many definitions were created or updated, review the results
with Load Equipment Definition or QA/QC before running placement workflows.
