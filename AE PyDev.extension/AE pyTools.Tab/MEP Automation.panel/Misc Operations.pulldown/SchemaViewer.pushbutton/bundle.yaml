title: Schema Viewer
tooltip: |
  Schema Viewer is a diagnostic helper that surfaces the raw Extensible Storage
  payload for the active YAML; use it when you need to inspect compressed history
  entries or metadata without leaving Revit.

  Run the button after Select YAML so the storage schema is populated; the viewer
  lists every entry, including timestamps, sequence numbers, and base text
  snapshots, making it easier to debug undo issues or confirm merges.

  You can copy any field directly from the dialog for documentation or support
  tickets, which helps correlate QA/QC output with the internal history stored in
  Project Information.

  Close the viewer when finished; it is read only, so there is zero risk of
  damaging the data, and you can safely relaunch it as often as necessary during
  investigations.
