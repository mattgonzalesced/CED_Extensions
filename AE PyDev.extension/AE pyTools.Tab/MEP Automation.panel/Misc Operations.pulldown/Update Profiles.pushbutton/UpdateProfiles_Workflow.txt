Run Update Profiles after adding tags, keynotes, or text notes to equipment that
already carries Element_Linker metadata, or after changing parameter values on
those elements. The tool scans all linked elements, finds their LED definitions,
and merges the new annotations and parameter values into the active YAML.

Once saved, rerun Place Linked Elements or Place Annotations so new views pick
up the updated definitions.
