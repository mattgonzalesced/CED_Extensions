Run Tag Equipment after Select Parent, Add YAML Profiles, or Place Linked
Elements whenever a definition includes hosted tag data. The command looks up
each instance by its Element_Linker payload, filters by dev-Group so you only
tag the intended equipment, and drops the captured tags at their recorded
offsets within the active view.

Launch it from whatever plan or sheet you need annotated; rerun for additional
views as required. If a tag family is missing, the summary lists the LED ID so
you can load the family or edit the definition and run Tag Equipment again.
