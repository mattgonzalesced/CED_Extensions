If your equipment definitions capture hosted tags, run Tag Equipment after a
placement pass to ensure every instance receives the annotation offsets and
orientations described in the YAML.

The tool scans for Element_Linker metadata, queries the definition to retrieve
tag families, and instantiates them on the specified view with the stored
offsets, rotation, and parameter overrides.

Because tags depend on view context, launch the workflow from the sheet or plan
where you want them to appear, and rerun for additional views if needed; the
automation reuses the same metadata, so you never have to reselect hosts.

If any tags fail to place, review the output for missing family warnings, then
update the definition or load the required tag families before rerunning the
command to finish annotation.
