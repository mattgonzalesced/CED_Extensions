Use Update Vector after you physically move already placed instances. Select a
host element, confirm the Element_Linker payload, and the tool recomputes the
local offsets in the parent’s coordinate system. Offsets, parent rotation, and
tag offsets are written to Extensible Storage, so subsequent placements match
what you just captured.

When prompted, choose whether to apply the new vector to other instances with
the same Linked Element Definition ID. The tool will automatically locate them,
move/rotate them by the same vector, refresh their Element_Linker payloads, and
update the YAML entry in one transaction. If no other instances exist you can
skip the propagation and only the selected element is updated.

Once Update Vector completes, rerun Place Linked Elements or Tag Equipment to
validate the geometry—those tools now respect the refreshed offsets exactly.
