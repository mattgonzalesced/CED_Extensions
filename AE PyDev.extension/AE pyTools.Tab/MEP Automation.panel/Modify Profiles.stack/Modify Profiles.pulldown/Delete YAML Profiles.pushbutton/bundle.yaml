title: Delete YAML Profiles
tooltip: |
  Only use Delete YAML Profiles after verifying the active YAML snapshot already
  reflects the project state you want to prune; the action cannot be undone
  without reverting through Extensible Storage history.

  Pick the equipment definition from the list to inspect its linked element
  definitions; the dialog displays each LED label with its identifier so you can
  confirm you are targeting the proper instances.

  Select every LED you want removed and review the summary prompt; if the
  definition becomes empty, the workflow also removes associated child links to
  stop orphaned references from persisting inside other configurations.

  When you accept the deletion, the tool writes the updated dataset back into
  Extensible Storage, records an audit entry, and reminds you to reload Place
  Elements before continuing with automated placements.
