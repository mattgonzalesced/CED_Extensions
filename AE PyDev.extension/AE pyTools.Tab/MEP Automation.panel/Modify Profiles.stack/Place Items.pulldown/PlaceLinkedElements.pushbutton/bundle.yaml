title: Place Linked Elements
tooltip: |
  Place Linked Elements is the primary automation button; it reads the active
  YAML, matches linked elements or Revit links by name, and places every recorded
  configuration on the correct centroid with preserved spacing.

  Before running, ensure Select YAML has loaded the desired file and that the
  project contains host families or linked groups whose names align with the
  equipment definitions you want to place.

  The engine assigns each placement to the linked element's level, reviews the
  summary of matched hosts, and sets Element_Linker metadata so QA/QC and Undo
  integration work seamlessly.

  After placement, inspect the resulting families, run QAQC if needed, and commit
  any required tweaks through Add, Edit, or Merge before exporting the updated
  YAML back to disk for coordination.
