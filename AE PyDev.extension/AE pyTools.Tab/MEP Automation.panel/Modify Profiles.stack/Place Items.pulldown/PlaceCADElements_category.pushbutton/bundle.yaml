title: Place CAD Elements by Category
tooltip: |
  Use Place CAD Elements to populate the model with legacy CSV driven
  arrangements, primarily when translating designs from older workflows into the
  current YAML driven environment for validation and cleanup.

  Provide the CSV file exported from CAD, review the column mappings, and specify
  the level or base plane; the engine reads each row, converts imperial offsets,
  and instantiates the referenced family types automatically.

  Because this process predates Extensible Storage, it does not consult the active
  YAML; treat it as a bridge tool for finishing existing projects while the team
  transitions to linked element definitions recorded through Add YAML Profiles.

  After placement, consider converting the resulting assemblies into YAML
  definitions so future iterations rely on the modern automation pipeline, then
  archive the original CSV for documentation purposes only.
