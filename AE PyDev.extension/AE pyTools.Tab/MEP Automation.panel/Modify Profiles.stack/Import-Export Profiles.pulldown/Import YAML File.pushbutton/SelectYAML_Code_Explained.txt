Select YAML – Code Explained
============================

Purpose
-------
Seed the project with a specific YAML file by copying its contents into
Extensible Storage on ProjectInformation, clearing previous entries, and
remembering the chosen path for quick access.

Step-by-Step
------------
1. **Path Setup** – Sets `LIB_ROOT` and imports `yaml_path_cache` plus the
   `seed_active_yaml` helper from `ExtensibleStorage.yaml_store`.
2. **Path Selection** – Uses `forms.pick_file` to let the user browse for a YAML
   file.  It defaults to either the cached path or the library’s profile file.
3. **Read Text** – Opens the file with UTF-8 encoding and reads the entire
   string; no parsing occurs here.
4. **Seed Storage** – Calls `seed_active_yaml(doc, path, raw_text)` which:
   * Clears previous entries for the same normalized path
   * Stores the base text compressed
   * Updates metadata (`active_yaml`) so other tools know which file is active
5. **Alerts** – Notifies the user that the YAML was loaded and that all tools
   now operate against the in-model copy.

Result
------
Every button references Extensible Storage rather than the disk file, enabling
undo support, history tracking, QA/QC, and exports—all keyed to the path chosen
via Select YAML.
