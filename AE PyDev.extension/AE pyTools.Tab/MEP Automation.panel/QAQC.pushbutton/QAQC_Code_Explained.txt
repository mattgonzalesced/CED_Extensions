QA/QC – Code Explained
======================

Mission
-------
Provide a snapshot of how well the automation is covering the project.  It
counts host elements found versus elements actually placed (by reading
Element_Linker metadata) and prints Markdown output summarizing progress.

Mechanics
---------
1. **Load YAML** – `load_active_yaml_data` supplies the definitions so the script
   knows which names to look for and how many linked element definitions each
   equipment definition contains.
2. **Host Counting** – `_collect_placeholder_counts` scans models and linked
   docs, producing counts keyed by normalized definition names.
3. **Placement Counting** – `_collect_placed_counts` iterates all instances with
   Element_Linker payloads, mapping them back to LEDs and definitions.
4. **Report Generation** – Results are printed via `script.get_output().print_md`
   so Revit’s output panel displays bold/italic entries, placed type totals, and
   configuration counts per definition.

Usage Notes
-----------
* Because the script divides placed counts by LED count per definition, you see
  a “configurations placed” number, giving a realistic view of how many full
  setups exist in the model.
* No data modifications occur; this is read-only analysis.
